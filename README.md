# Wrangle-and-Analyse-WeRateDogs
Really world data can be dirty as well as messy, i.e., it can have quality as well as structural issues. Both of these can make the analysis not just inaccurate but really hard. Hence, wrangling the data cannot be stressed enough. This project of mine is primarily focused towards wrangling the data set of WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.  Rating numerators are greater than the denominators.This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
